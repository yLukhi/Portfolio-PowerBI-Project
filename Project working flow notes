=======5 Step Data Analysis project=======
1) Requirement Understanding
2) Mockups & Solutions design
3) Data collections & Data modelling
4) Dashboarding & Insight generation
5) Stackholder’s feedback


=======Who am I here?=======

I’m a data analyst who has been provided with sample data and a mock-up dashboard
to work on the following task. I have download all relevant documents from the email.

======= Milestone 1/5 Requirement Understanding =======
(Problem statement)
1. Create the metrics according to the metric list.
2. Create a dashboard according to the mock-up provided by stakeholders.
3. Create relevant insights that are not provided in the metric list/mock-up
dashboard.
(looking at all documents)


======= Milestone 2/5 Mockups & Solutions design =======
(Mock up review with stackholder)
Interesting facts+info from Domain expert/stackholder:
1) Weekends in hospitality is Fri-Sat not Sat-Sun.
2) Revenue[100% money of booking] from cancellation is not counted in main
revenue due to accounting purpose.
3) (get IMP metric list from them to show on dashboard).
4) After level 1 analysis - holistic view, in level 2 add filter of channels(from where
booking was done).
5) Level 1 metric tell you there’s a problem or not. If ans is yes then got to next
level
Level 2 metric tell you why there’s a problem
6) Dashboards should answer WHYs.


======= Milestone 3/5 Data collections & Data modelling =======
(Pipelines – Data source->Power Query->DAX->Dashboarding)
======= Milestone 4/5 Dashboarding & Insight generation ======
(Data transformation using Power query and data modeling)
1) A power query is a nothing but place where you can do your data transformation
2) Modeling — Star schema(fact table is surrounded by dimension tables, like SQL)
3) Manage relationship for PowerBI and Slice and Dice
(Building matrices using DAX -data analysis expression)
1) DAX – Calculated columns & Measures – making 26 different measures
(Build The Visuals and Dashboard in PowerBI)
1) Created table with all — — fields….don't know why they choose on first place
2) Created multiple sami dashboards and graphs and attached them in one
dashboard


======= Milestone 5/5 Stackholder’s feedback =======
1) Important key metrics order changes: RevPAR// Occupancy// ADR// Realisation
2) Set important key metrics for weekday and weekend as a row.
3) Booking platform as known as channels.
4) Line graph relation might show revenue opportunity if RevPER is not changing
and occupancy is changing.
5) There are three types of pricing:
Flat Pricing
Weekday/Weekend Pricing
Dynamic Pricing
6) Key question: How does PRICING influence The Occupancy?
7) The Pareto Principle: Effort: 20/80 Results: 80/20
8) Graph of rating inside the main table and occupancy are related to each other.
